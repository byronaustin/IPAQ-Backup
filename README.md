IPAQ-Backup
===========

Program to copy a variety of selectrd file types from the volatile memory of HP IPAQ to the non-volatile SD Card

When the IPAQ is allowed to discharge it's battery completely, all user memory is lost unless it is stored on
the SD Memory card. 

This application was designed to give the user a listbox with file types, the user then can 
select the types of files that should be backed up. 

The application then creates a backup copy of the most recent file in a backup file on the SC card and it copies any 
previous copies from the backup folder to an archive folder on the SD card. 

Each copied file is give a new extension with a date and identifying it as a backup 

File can be recovered my copying them and manually changing the file name/extension or using the Recover 
application and automatically recovering selected files.
